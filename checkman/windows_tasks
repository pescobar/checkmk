 The Windows Task Scheduler Checks controlls the last return state of windows task scripts.
 The check goes to {WARNING} state, if the task is disabled. If the Script from the Task returns
 another return code as "0", "1", "267009", "267014", "267045", "-2147216609", "-2147750687"
 the Check goes {CRITICAL}.
 In order to run, its needed to copy the windows_tasks.ps1 script to the plugin folder of the agent.
=======
 This check plugin monitors the last return state of Windows tasks. The check plugin uses a default
 mapping from return code to monitoring state to handle the return codes specified under
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-error-and-success-constants.
 For these return codes, the check plugin will also display the appropriate error message. Any return
 code not listed under the above link will by default result in the monitoring state {CRITICAL}.
 Furthermore, by default, the check plugin will go {WARNING} if a monitored task is not enabled.

 The check plugin can be configured via the rule "Windows Tasks". Here, users can customize the
 mapping from return code to monitoring state and users can also change the output produced by the
 check plugin for a given return code. Finally, this rule allows users to modify the monitoring state
 of tasks which are not enabled.

 Note that for this check plugin to discover any services at all, you need to activate the Windows
 agent plugin "Windows Task Scheduler".
