=======
 Monitors the operational state of the SAS Port and the associated physical
 interfaces of Atto Fibrebridge 6500N Controllers.

 The service state changes depending on the operational state:

 - {OK} for "online"

 - {WARN} for "degraded"

 - {CRIT} for "offline"

 - {UNKOWN} for "unknown"

 For the physical interfaces the service is always {OK}.

 This check uses the ATTO6500N-MIB.
