 value is set 100, which is the default limit imposed by AWS.
 These levels are configurable using the rule "AWS/S3 Limits".

 Since there are no per-region limits, the regions selected when
 configuring the AWS special agent do not apply here. Instead, this
 check will always collect all buckets, regardless of their regions.
 Also, possibly configured restriction to names or tags are not
 taken into account.

inventory:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
