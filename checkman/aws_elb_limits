 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max.
 value is fetched from the API, ie.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - 20 load balancers
 - 100 listeners per load balancer
 - 1000 registered instances per load balancer.
=======

 - 20 load balancers

 - 100 listeners per load balancer

 - 1000 registered instances per load balancer.

 These levels are configurable.

 If limits are enabled all load balancers are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.
