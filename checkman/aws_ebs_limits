 This check monitors the AWS/EBS limits.

>>>>>>> upstream/master
 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 We get the following default limits:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Total Block store snapshots: 100000
 - Total Magnetic volumes space: 300 TiB
 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD space: 300 TiB
 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD IO operations per second: 300000
 - Total General Purpose SSD space: 300 TiB
 - Total Cold HDD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Block store snapshots: 100000

 - Total Magnetic volumes space: 300 TiB

 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD IO operations per second: 300000

 - Total General Purpose SSD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Cold HDD space: 300 TiB

>>>>>>> upstream/master
 - Total Throughput Optimized HDD space: 300 TiB

 The current value for each limit type is calculated by summing
 up the related values from API method {{describe_volumes}}.

 With both values we calculate the usage of each limit type
<<<<<<< HEAD
 in percent. Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent per type.
 For each limit type the limit and usage levels are configurable.

=======
 in percent.

 The default {WARN}/{CRIT} levels are set to 80, 90 percent per type.

 For each limit type the limit and usage levels are configurable.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if one or more of these levels are exceeded.

>>>>>>> upstream/master
 If limits are enabled all volumes are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

inventory:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 One service will be created.
=======
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
