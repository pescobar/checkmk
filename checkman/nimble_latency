<<<<<<< HEAD
 This check monitors the latency of read IO operations. The total reads will
 always be displayed. Additionally read IO latency groups will be displayed
 if the counter is greater than a given threshold. The state will change
 accordingly to the defined threshold.

 Thresholds and correlating states can be defined for each latency group.

 One services for each volume will be created.
=======
 This check monitors the latency of read IO operations. This is shown as the
 number of read IO operations as a percentage of total read IO operations within
 a particular latency range. A latency range is a range of time intervals,
 e.g. 0-0.1 ms, 0.1-0.2 ms, etc.

 Thresholds for WARN and CRIT states can be defined, along with the starting
 range from which the levels are relevant. For example, show a WARN if 10% of
 overall read IO operations have a latency of 10-20 ms or above, and CRIT if 20%
 of overall read IO operations reach this threshold. The corresponding ruleset
 for these thresholds is named "Nimble IO levels".
