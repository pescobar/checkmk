Checks like <tt>if</tt> and <tt>ps</tt> detect additional information during the service discovery.
This information is stored in the <tt>~/var/check_mk/autochecks/{hostname}.mk</tt> for the corresponding host.
Due to a bug this information was discarded, whenever this check had some timespecific parameters set.
