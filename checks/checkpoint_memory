# FIXME
# The WATO group 'memory_simple' needs an item and the service_description should
# have a '%s'.  At the moment the current item 'System' and 'Memory' without '%s'
# works but is not consistent.  This will be fixed in the future.
# If we change this we loose history and parameter sets have to be adapted.
